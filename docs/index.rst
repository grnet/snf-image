Welcome to snf-image's documentation!
=====================================

.. image:: /images/logo.png

snf-image is a `Ganeti <http://code.google.com/p/ganeti/>`_ OS definition. It
allows Ganeti to launch instances from predefined or untrusted custom Images.
The whole process of deploying an Image onto the block device, as provided by
Ganeti, is done in complete isolation from the physical host, enhancing
robustness and security.

snf-image supports `KVM <http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page>`_ and
`Xen <http://www.xenproject.org/>`_ based Ganeti clusters.

snf-image also supports Image customization via hooks. Hooks allow for:

 * Changing the password of root or arbitrary users
 * Injecting files into the file system, e.g., SSH keys
 * setting a custom hostname
 * re-creating SSH host keys to ensure the image uses unique keys

snf-image is being used in large scale production environments with Ganeti to
successfully deploy many major Linux distributions (Debian, Ubuntu/Kubuntu,
CentOS, Fedora, OpenSUSE, Slackware, Arch Linux), Windows Server flavors
(2008 R2, 2012, 20012 R2), as well as BSD systems (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD).

The snf-image Ganeti OS Definition is released under
`GPLv2 <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html>`_.
