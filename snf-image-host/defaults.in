# HELPER_TIMEOUT: Soft and hard timeout limits for helper instance. The helper
# instance will be terminated after a given time if it hasn't exited by itself.
# A TERM signal will be send if the instance is running after a
# HELPER_SOFT_TIMEOUT interval. A KILL signal will be sent, if the instance is
# still running after a HELPER_HARD_TIMEOUT interval since the initial signal
