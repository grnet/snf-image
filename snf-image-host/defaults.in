# HELPER_TIMOUT: Soft and hard timeout limits for helper instance. The helper
# instance will be terminated after a given time if it hasn't exited by itself.
# A TERM signal will be send if the instance is running after a
# HELPER_SOFT_TIMEOUT interval. A KILL signal will be sent, if the instance is
# still running after a HELPER_HARD_TIMEOUT interval since the initial signal
# was sent. The timeout values are integer numbers with an optional suffix: `s'
# for seconds (the default), `m' for minutes, `h' for hours or `d' for days.
# HELPER_SOFT_TIMEOUT="120"
# HELPER_HARD_TIMEOUT="5"

# HELPER_USER: For security reasons, it is recommended that the helper VM
